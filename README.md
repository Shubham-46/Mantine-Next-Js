# Mantine-Next-Js

#I was having difficulties pushing all the folders due to having multiple GitHub accounts on my laptop.

#I have created these two files. If you want to test, you'll need to replace the layout.tsx with mine and also create a file named UserCard with the same content as mine.

#To set up the project and run it:

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run build`.
3. Install React Icons by running `npm i react-icons`.
4. Install Axios by running `npm i axios`.
5. Start the application by running `npm run dev`.

Below are some screenshots of the application.
